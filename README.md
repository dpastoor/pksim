pksim
==========

To get started:

```
npm install
```

the package is designed for on the fly babel compiling, by using `entry.js` as
the only es5-only file. Therefore, es6 code for whatever 'interactive' work
can be written in `pksimtest.js` and will automatically be converted on the fly

Therefore, to run the contents of pksimtest.js just run

```
node entry.js
```
